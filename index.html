  <div class="first">
    <p>Narcolepsy Symptoms <span class="type">Prezi slide</span><br />
    <small>Sample of presentation slides created in Prezi, which intentionally encapsulate design principles such as contrast and proximity. In addition, cognitive load is reduced by only introducing two symptoms on this slide instead of all four. The image from Unsplash has been included to help link the concepts presented as per the contiguity principle.  </small></p>

  <div class="second">
    <p>Comparing Zoom and Microsoft Teams<span class="type">H5P activity within a Moodle course</span><br />
    <small>This ‘Interactive Book’ H5P interactive activity is embedded with two ‘Multiple Choice’ H5P interactive activities allows the features of both Zoom and Microsoft Teams to be shown side by side. This is an example of designed interactivity, which encourages the student to choose one or more of the features listed and then check if they are correct to infer meaning.</small></p>

  <div class="third">
    <p>Discord Quick Start Guide <span class="type">Canva infographic</span><br />
    <small>A one page reference created for a Discord community to help those new to the platform familiarise themselves with the basic functions of the communication platform. Complementary colours were used to increase contrast and bullet points were used to increase readability. </small></p>
